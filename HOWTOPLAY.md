### Attacking
Attacking other players is a crucial part of Terminal Monopoly. Successfully attacking other players will cripple their mobility on their terminals, and put them in precarious situations on the gameboard.
#### Types of Attacks
All attacks are played out by winning against another player in some **active** module. In the [Modules](#modules) section, anything starred (*) can be ran as an attack module. 
##### Fraud
Stealing other player's capital is a quick-and-dirty way to increase your net worth while decreasing theirs.   
- Liquid Capital
  Directly transfer part of their held cash into your account.
- Properties
  Force a player to sell a property to you for free. They immediately sell all houses on that property as per normal Monopoly rules (1/2 price), then transfer the ownership to you.
- Houses
  "Renovate" a player's houses onto your property. They do not lose the property, just a set number of houses / hotels from that location. 

##### DoS
The impact of killing another player's terminal can be severe depending on the current state of the game. Removing effectively 1/4 (or more!) of a player's terminal mobility will decrease their productivity, defenses, and accumulation of capital.
- Disabling a terminal will prevent a player from running any commands on it, and it will automatically be restored after a certain amount of time.
- Killing a terminal will permanently prevent a player from running any commands on it.
