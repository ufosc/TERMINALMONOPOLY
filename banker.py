    Description:
        This is the main game loop for Monopoly.
        It will be called from the main function in its own thread. 
    Notes:
        Monopoly command looks like this: "mply,<action>,<specific data>,<even more specific data>,<etc>" 

        player_roll all happens on the player side, so the player can handle all of that. 
        All data during player_roll will be sent to banker like the following:
        recv_message() -> handle_data() -> monopoly_game()
        Where monopoly_game parses the data and banker does not need to send anything back. 

        Now for player_choice, banker and player will do a bit more back and forth.
        Most of the game logic can be handled on the player side, but banker will
        have to preface the messages with cash, properties, etc.
