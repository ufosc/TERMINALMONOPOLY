        Monopoly command looks like this: "mply,(action),(specific data),(even more specific data),(etc)" 

        player_roll all happens on the player side, so the player can handle all of that.

        recv_message() -> handle_data() -> monopoly_game()
        Where monopoly_game parses the data and banker does not need to send anything back. 

        Now for player_choice, banker and player will do a bit more back and forth.
        Most of the game logic can be handled on the player side, but banker will
        have to preface the messages with cash, properties, etc.
